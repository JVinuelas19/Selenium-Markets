I'm developing an app to deploy a market shift management tool where each store can CRUD their employees. In order to create a more "real" proyect, i started scrapping all stores from an actual super market. The satisfaction on crafting a database with real information through an automated methodology lead my curiosity to obtain different databases for each supermarket. So this is basically a big data project. After data collection i will create a Power BI report with key info. 

Store data for each super market chain is variable in obtention and content: using Selenium to scrape data from the website, playing with DevTools to manipulate API querys, obtaining straight XMLs and JSONs containing store information, etc. I've tried to standardize each super market database in order to develop a "Super Market Finder" app. I have develop an automation to extract latitude and longitude for each Market store using GoogleV3 Geocoding API, enhancing location data and allowing to create this finder app.

The idea is getting familiar with creating/updating some actual SQL databases, learn Selenium. In the near future, once the database creation phase is over, i will start developing a React app with some Maps that can filter different markets through citys, post codes, market names, services, etc. 

Meanwhile i will be updating this repo with the codes developed for each market chain.
